Removes the '/blog' slug from the main site permalinks in a multisite.

== Description ==

This plugin removes the '/blog' slug from the main site permalinks of a sub-folder multisite install. The intended purpose for this plugin
is for multilingual installations where the main site is the default language (although I'm sure there are other applications).  These sites
are of often for businesses where having the '/blog' in the permalink (URL) does not make sense.

'/blog' is automatically removed from the main site permalinks upon plugin activation.

'/blog' is automatically restored in permalinks upon plugin deactivation.
